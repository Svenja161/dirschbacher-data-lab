- **Explained, not just delivered**: Results are prepared so they can be shared internally with ease.  
- **Pragmatic**: I prefer a clear, robust approach over overly complex models without added value.

## About me

I am a social scientist specializing in urban and regional development, working primarily with quantitative methods.  
I’m especially interested in topics such as **migration, housing, inequality, and social networks** — and how data can help us understand them better.
